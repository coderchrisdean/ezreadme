## Description
This is a Node.js application that uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for information about their project and generates a professional README.md file with the user's input. The file includes a title, a table of contents, and sections for description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. The license section includes a badge for the chosen license and a notice explaining which license the project is covered under. The questions section includes the user's GitHub username and email address. When the user provides the necessary input and hits Enter, the script generates the README.md file and saves it to ./assets/READMEMAKER/ directory.
